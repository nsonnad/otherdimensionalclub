Hi! This is otherdimensional club, the digital home of nikhil sonnad (me).

I do a lot of different things: music, data visualization, journalism, teaching, writing, etc etc. This site serves as both a portfolio of my varied work and a place for me to share
updates and thoughts. Browse by the color-coded categories below if you want to narrow
things down, or view all to see everything I've been up to. If you want
something a bit more official, check out [my CV](cv).

Thanks and welcome!
