### Work experience

#### Optimiser

##### Data visiualization and dashboard engineer, 2023-2024

➔ OptiMiser, an energy data analysis and software company, came to me looking to replace a set of legacy Tableau dashboards with a custom, in-house solution.

➔ Within a year, I successfully improved on Tableau, creating a custom JavaScript dashboard system that is flexible, versatile, and customizable, far more performant than Tableau, and much better oriented to the needs of Optimiser's users. (See more in the [write-up](/notes/flexible,-custom-dashboard-system-developed-for-government-green-energy-monitoring/).)

#### City University New York

##### Adjunct Instructor in Data Journalism, 2021-2023

➔ Taught two semesters of Fundamentals of Data Journalism, a first-semester course for incoming M.A. students at CUNY journalism school, and one of Coding the News, which focuses on advanced web programming for journalists.

➔ Topics covered include data storytelling, data analysis and reporting with Excel, statistics for journalists, and creating journalistic charts and maps.

#### Quartz

##### Reporter, 2014-2020

➔ Helped create the documentary video series Because China. I was the primary reporter, interviewer, and script-writer for several episodes. I reported from many countries for the show, including Zambia, Brazil, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Kenya.

➔ Wrote feature articles on a wide range of topics—including language, Facebook, Chinese politics, the internet, philosophy, and more—encompassing investigative reporting, data journalism, essays, reportage, and satire.

➔ Was a member of Quartz’s “Things” team, which was responsible for experiments in journalism involving data visualization, data-driven reporting, graphics, mapping, and interactive stories. My work in this area won several accolades, including multiple Malofiej, Data Journalism, and Information is Beautiful awards.

#### The Global Mail

##### Data Journalist, 2012-2014

➔ Produced collaborative data-driven stories, visualizations, and interactives at this (now-defunct) Australian public-interest journalism outlet. Stories included an interactive video documentary of an asylum seeker's journey from Afghanistan to Australia, and a data-driven investigation of post-traumatic stress disorder in the Australian military.
