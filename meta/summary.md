# Comprehensive Digital Garden Project Summary

## Project Overview
- Creating a unified online presence for diverse professional and creative work
- Inspired by Zettelkasten note-taking system and digital garden concept
- Balancing professional presentation with creative expression
- Showcasing work in data visualization, web development, music (under alias "egg plant"), writing, and teaching

## Key Requirements
1. Flexible organization of varied content types
2. Showcase both professional and artistic/experimental work
3. Cross-disciplinary tagging and linking of content
4. Customizable homepage with featured content and recent updates
5. Capability for interactive elements (e.g., D3.js visualizations) in individual notes
6. Ability to create and maintain content easily
7. Responsive design for various devices

## Conceptual Design

### 1. Notes (Zettels)
- Primary content units
- Self-contained pieces of work, ideas, or projects
- Can include text, images, and interactive elements

### 2. Tagging System
- Flexible, user-defined tags
- Examples: #data-visualization, #paid-work, #music, #egg-plant, #writing, #teaching
- Allow multiple tags per note

### 3. Homepage (Entry Points)
- Brief introduction with linked tags to key areas
- Featured content section (manually curated)
- Quick access to predefined filtered views (e.g., "Paid Work", "Released Music")
- Recently updated notes section
- Tag cloud or categorized tag list

### 4. Main Notes View
- List of all notes, sortable by recency or alphabetically
- Sidebar with filtering options (by tags, date range, etc.)
- Search functionality

### 5. Individual Note View
- Full content display with metadata (creation date, last edited date, tags)
- Links to related notes
- Option to include custom JavaScript for interactive elements

## Technical Approach

### Core Technologies
- Static Site Generator: Eleventy (11ty)
- Client-side JavaScript: Vanilla JS with optional use of libraries like D3.js
- Styling: CSS with PostCSS for processing

### Note Structure (Markdown + Front Matter)
```yaml
---
title: My Data Visualization Project
date: 2023-07-16
updated: 2023-07-16
tags: 
  - data-visualization
  - paid-work
customJS: 
  - /assets/js/d3-visualization.js
---

Content of the note goes here...

<div id="visualization"></div>
```

### Custom JavaScript for Notes
- Specify custom JS files in note's front matter
- Include these scripts in the note layout template

### Dynamic Tag Interactions
- Generate JSON file with all notes and their metadata during build
- Use client-side JavaScript for filtering and tag interactions

### Build Process
- Install dependencies: `npm install @11ty/eleventy d3`
- Add build script to package.json: `"build": "eleventy"`
- Run build: `npm run build`

## Next Steps
1. Refine technical implementation details
   - Decide on specific Eleventy plugins to use
   - Plan the structure of layouts and includes
2. Design the user interface
   - Create wireframes for homepage, main notes view, and individual note view
   - Decide on color scheme and typography
3. Develop a content migration strategy
   - Plan how to convert existing content into the new note format
   - Develop a tagging strategy for existing content
4. Implement core functionality
   - Set up basic Eleventy project structure
   - Create templates for different views
   - Implement tagging and filtering system
5. Develop custom features
   - Create system for including custom JavaScript in notes
   - Implement dynamic tag filtering on the client-side
6. Testing and refinement
   - Test on various devices and browsers
   - Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments

## Additional Considerations
- Ensure the system remains flexible for future content types and interests
- Consider implementing a light/dark mode toggle for better user experience
- Plan for potential future features like a newsletter or RSS feed
- Consider strategies for optimizing site performance, especially for pages with many notes or complex visualizations
